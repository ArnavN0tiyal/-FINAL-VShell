# About VShell
VShell is a console-run shell emulator which is fully made in java.
Current version - 1.3.6
# Important
Note that VShell is a program which runs in the console, so the jar file will also run in the console.
The terminal is finalized for now and will not be updated since I don't have any new ideas for this shell, if I have any new ideas I will add it and unfinalize the shell.
